## 🛠️ Installation and Deployment (For Developers)

This repository contains the landing page for the upcoming Creepercraft Minecraft server. If you'd like to set up or contribute to this landing page, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    You can download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

    *If you downloaded the ZIP, simply unzip it to your desired directory.*

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run in Development Mode:**
    To start a local development server with hot-reloading:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will usually start the server at `http://localhost:3000` (or similar), which you can open in your web browser.

4.  **Build for Production:**
    When you're ready to deploy your changes, build the project for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >This command will compile and optimize all the project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) into a `dist/` directory (or similar, depending on your build configuration). This `dist/` directory contains the static files ready for deployment.

### Deployment

The `dist/` directory (generated after `npm run build`) is what you will deploy to your hosting provider.

* **Netlify:**
    You can easily deploy the `dist/` folder to Netlify by connecting your GitHub repository and specifying `dist/` as the publish directory in your Netlify site settings.

* **GitHub Pages:**
    You can host the contents of your `dist/` directory on GitHub Pages. There are several ways to do this, including pushing the `dist/` content to a `gh-pages` branch or using a specific workflow.

* **Other Static Site Hosts:**
    The `dist/` folder can be deployed to any static site hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Firebase Hosting, Apache/Nginx static file serving, etc.) by simply uploading its contents.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Always run `npm run build` before deploying to ensure you have the latest optimized production-ready files.
